The following files in here were copied from themes/vex-hugo/static/plugins/.

bootstrap/
jquery/
slick/
themefisher-font/

This is so that we can fingerprint them to cache bust.

The themefisher-font/themefisher-font.min.css file needed ../ in 4 places in order to find it's nested fonts. I also removed the redundant query strings.

I moved the themefisher-fonts into static/fonts/ as this is the only place that works.
