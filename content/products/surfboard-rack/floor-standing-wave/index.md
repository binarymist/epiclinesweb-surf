After many months of R&D _EpicLines_ presents its lovingly engineered and crafted floor-standing surfboard rack, an aesthetically pleasing and functional way to store and showcase your quiver.

It can be erected as a left or right-breaking wave, or put a couple together as a peak.

Stores 4+ surfboards with fins.

Epoxy (2-pack) spray-coated over 18mm MDF.

Supports:
  Longboards
  Shortboards
  Mid lengths
  Grovelers
  Hybrids
  Guns
  All tail types
  All fin configurations

Can store boards in bags or without.

The horizontal construction is a 6mm high tensile threaded rod passing through a steel tube with washes welded at each end of the crush tube
to create high-tension EVA foam-coated laterals. This provides excellent bracing and protection for your board's tails and rails once erected.

* Height: 1500mm
* Width: 600mm
* Depth: 1018mm (assembled size)
* Interior use only
* Easy to assemble
