> The 2026 Annual Drop: Available Until They're Gone.

After many months of R&D, _EpicLines_ presents its lovingly engineered and crafted Floor-Standing Wave surfboard rack,
an aesthetically pleasing and functional way to store and showcase your quiver.
This design allows for a seamless storage solution, keeping your boards protected and ready for making lines. Made by the beach in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Variations: left-hand breaking wave or right-hand breaking wave, or put a couple together as a peak.

Stores 4+ surfboards with fins.

Epoxy (2-pack) spray system over 18mm MDF.

Supports:
  Longboards,
  Shortboards,
  Mid lengths,
  Grovelers,
  Fish,
  Hybrids,
  Guns,
  All tail types,
  All fin configurations.

Can store boards in bags or without.

The horizontal construction is a 6mm high tensile threaded rod passing through a steel tube with washers welded at each end of the crush tube
to create high-tension EVA foam-coated laterals. This provides excellent bracing and protection for your board's tails and rails once erected.
The edges of the uprights are double-rounded, making them feel smooth to the touch.
