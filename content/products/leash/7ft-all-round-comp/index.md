## Design decisions

Four decades of surfing experience have shaped our design. We created leashes that perform under pressure.

<i class='tf-ion-waterdrop'></i> &nbsp; We designed lightweight, yet strong low-profile cuffs with _EpicLines_ gel print for secure, easy strapping.<br>
<i class='tf-ion-waterdrop'></i> &nbsp; Double swivels reduce tangles and keep the leash out of your pop-up zone.<br>
<i class='tf-ion-waterdrop'></i> &nbsp; Quick release tab instantly frees you in emergencies.<br>
<i class='tf-ion-waterdrop'></i> &nbsp; Soft and strong detachable railsaver allows for fast leash swapping.<br>
<i class='tf-ion-waterdrop'></i> &nbsp; We rigorously test each model for breaking tension.<br>
<i class='tf-ion-waterdrop'></i> &nbsp; Our leashes come in different cord thicknesses: thinner for smaller waves to reduce drag and thicker for bigger waves to provide confidence and security.<br>

Choose the right leash for your board type and length, wave conditions, and lineup crowd.

Designed by _EpicLines_ (NZ surfers) for wherever your travels may take you.
