## Design decisions

Four decades of surfing experience shaped our design. We created leashes that perform under pressure.

We designed lightweight, yet strong low-profile cuffs with _EpicLines_ gel print for secure, easy strapping
Double swivels reduce tangles and keep the leash out of your pop-up zone
Quick release tab instantly frees you in emergencies
Soft and strong detachable railsaver allows for fast leash swapping
We rigorously test each model for breaking tension
Our leashes come in different cord thicknesses: thinner for smaller waves to reduce drag and thicker for bigger waves to provide confidence and security
Choose the right leash for your board type and length, wave conditions, and lineup crowd.

Designed by _EpicLines_ (NZ surfers) for wherever your travels may take you.
