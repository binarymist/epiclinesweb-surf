## Design decisions

Four decades of surfing experience has shaped our design. We created leashes that perform under pressure.

We designed lightweight, yet strong, low-profile cuffs with _EpicLines_ gel print for secure, easy strapping.  
Double swivels reduce tangles and keep the leash out of your pop-up zone.  
The quick-release tab instantly frees you in emergencies.  
Soft and strong detachable railsaver allows for fast leash swapping.  
We rigorously test each model for breaking tension.  
Our leashes come in different cord thicknesses: thinner for smaller waves to reduce drag and thicker for bigger waves to provide confidence and security.  
Choose the right leash for your board type and length, wave conditions, and lineup crowd.

Designed by _EpicLines_ (New Zealand surfers) for wherever your travels may take you.
