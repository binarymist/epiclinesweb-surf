Surfing bucket hat, great for keeping the hot sun off of your head and out of your eyes.
Breathable fabric. UPF50+. Adjustable soft neoprene chin strap. Strong clasp.
Comfortable to wear, yet stiff enough to reatain shape.

These surf bucket hats have proved themselves in Indo, staying on under some fairly heavy waves.
If you're concerned about duck-diving and losing your hat, you can put a thin rope on the back of these and attach it to your top.

The hat also has a reflector attached to the rear for night riding.

Head curcumference adjustment to cater for different head sizes and how big the waves are when duck-diving.

Size: 55-60cm.

One size fits all.
