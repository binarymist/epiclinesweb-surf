Closed-cell waterproof EVA, high-grade adhesive formula, offers maximum, long-lasting adhesion in water.

Arch supports for front and back pads.
30mm back-foot block.

No more grotty wax all over your wetties, no more forgetting your wax or wax comb, and far superior grip to wax.

We have used this full-deck traction pad on one of our Pyzel daily drivers and grovelers which we surf all around New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, and Indonesia, and love this full-deck grip!
