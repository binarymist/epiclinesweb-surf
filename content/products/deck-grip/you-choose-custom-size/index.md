This listing is for one strip of black 80mm x 550mm deck grip.

We can cut any number of deck grips to any size to fit your surfboard.

Great for extending standard traction pads to work for mals/mini mals, or wherever you need a little more traction on your surfboard deck.

We can also supply full long board and SUP grips.

just let us know what shape, size, and number of pieces you require and we will cut them and send you an invoice.
